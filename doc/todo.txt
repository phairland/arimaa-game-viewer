- should rename moves to steps in code
- verification of imported annotated game (important for user)

- stepbuffer clearing (undo & when user presses next/prev move)

- players could suggest a move to particular node, so that they are put into suggested moves and one who has control could pick it up

- how to show variations in UI?

- steps less than 4 in a move (pass)
