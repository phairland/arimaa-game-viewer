- should rename moves to steps in code
- verification of imported annotated game

- stepbuffer clearing (undo & user presses next/prev move)
- show comments in nodes

- players could suggest a move to particular node, so that they are put into suggested moves and one who has control could pick it up

- how to show variations in UI?
